# Project1OS
Using getopt to parse options and fork to create child processes

-----------------------------------------

Options aren't required, and if not given, the program will default to using input.dat for input and output.dat for output.

HOWEVER, if options are included in the invocation, an argument file must be specified or else a perror message will be thrown.

Please ensure that those files specified in the argument do actually exist, or else the program won't function properly.

The Makefile compiles and links the program, and from there, the user must only run the executable output file.
